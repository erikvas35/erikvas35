I am a undergraduate student at the University of Maryland College Park! I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science with a specilization on cybersecurity. I am a very dedicated learner and I am very intrigued by everything that has to do with cybersecurity!

## Objective

My journey in cybersecurity has lead me to want to learn more about network engineering, analysis, and much more. I am very interested in learning about how all networking functions and how it is used in day to day life and that has led me to be very interested in becoming a SOC Analyst!
